            <li>Heat remaining oil and 1 tablespoon butter in a skillet or pan over medium-high heat until combined and hot.</li>
            <li>Sear chicken in batches for 5-7 minutes each side until golden or internal temperature is 165°F / 75°C using a meat thermometer. Remove from pan; set aside to rest for 5 minutes.</li>
            <li><strong>While chicken is resting, make the sauce.</strong> Reduce heat to medium. Melt remaining butter in the pan. Sauté garlic until fragrant (about 30 seconds), while scraping up any browned bits from the pan. Pour in the broth and let reduce for 2-3 minutes, while stirring occasionally.</li>
            <li>Take pan off the heat. Drizzle sauce over chicken.</li>
