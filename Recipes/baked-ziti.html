        Do you like lasagna, but not the fuss? Make baked ziti instead!
    <p></p>
        It's a lot like a classic lasagna casserole, but easier to make and without lots of layers or broken noodles.
    <P></P>
        It makes for a perfect midweek or weekend meal, or a hot dish to bring to a potluck. Make extra and freeze for later.

                <li>8 ounces shredded mozzarella cheese</li>
                <li>1 cup grated Parmesan or pecorino cheese</li>

            <h3>Cooking instructions</h3>
                <ol>
                    <li>Preheat oven:</li>
                        <p>Preheat the oven to 350°F.</p>
                    <li>Cook pasta:</li>
                        <p>Heat a large pot of salted water (for every 2 quarts of water, one tablespoon of salt) to a strong boil. Add the pasta and cook at a rolling boil, uncovered, until the pasta is al dente—edible but still a little firm to the bite.</p>
                        <p>Drain the pasta through a colander. Toss with a little olive oil so the pasta does not stick together while you make the sauce.</p>
                    <li>Brown the meat:</li>
                        <p>While the water is heating in the previous step, start on the sauce. Heat a tablespoon of olive oil in a large sauté pan on medium-high heat. When the oil is shimmering hot, add the bulk sausage or ground meat. Break up any large chunks of sausage as it cooks. Brown well.</p>
                        <p>Don't stir that often or it will be more difficult for the meat to brown. If you are using ground beef or pork instead of sausage, sprinkle with a little salt.</p>
                    <li>Make the sauce:</li>
                        <p>When the meat is mostly browned, add the onions and stir well to combine. Sauté everything until the onions are translucent and beginning to brown, about 4 to 5 minutes.</p>
                        <p>Add the garlic, rosemary or basil, Italian seasoning, and red pepper flakes and stir to combine. Cook 1 minute, then add the tomato sauce and stir well. Bring to a simmer.</p>
                        <p>Taste the sauce and season with salt and pepper, if needed.</p>
                    <li>Assemble the casserole:</li>
                        <p>Spread a thin layer of the sauce in the bottom of a 9x13-inch casserole pan, then dot the surface with half the ricotta cheese. Ladle a spoonful of sauce into the pasta, stir it well and then add the pasta into the casserole.</p>
                        <p>Pour the rest of the sauce over the pasta, dot the remaining ricotta cheese over the pasta, and sprinkle on top both the mozzarella and the Parmesan cheese.</p>
                        <p>At this point, you can cool, cover, and refrigerate or freeze to make ahead.</p>
                    <li>Bake:</li>
                        <p>Bake uncovered in the oven at 350°F until the top is lightly browned and the cheese melted, about 20 to 25 minutes. Let stand for 10 minutes before serving.</p>
